# Small-World-Phenomenon
The project main idea is the Small World Experiment,This experiment conducted by Stanley Milgram and other researchers examining 
the average path length for social networks of people in the United States.
The research was groundbreaking in that it suggested that human society is a small-world-type network characterized by short path-lengths.
Thier is two main terminologies are of interest to us in this project:
1.Degree of separation:
Between any two persons, is defined as the shortest chain of links that leads one person to the other.
2.Relation Strength
Between any two persons, is defined as the total number of common "factors" between each two persons in the shortest chain of links. 
If there're many shortest chains of links with the same length, the relation strength is then the one with max common "factors".

This project test dataset is movies/actors dataset.
The program returns path with smallest number of vetcies and highest weight, and print chain of actors and thier movies
it also contains all the test cases from small to extreme.

The Project is for Analysis and Design of Algorithm course in Ain shams university, course teacher is Dr.Ahmed Salah
the files contain pdf with full code analysis and complexity.


maximum test time: 57s

future Update:
1.file reading is too slow
